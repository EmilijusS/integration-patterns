# Enterprise Integration Patterns using Pipes

This repository contains several [Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/) I implemented for my bachelor's thesis in Vilnius University.

Pipes: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes>

Pipes.Concurrent: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-concurrency>

`src\Patterns` contains implementations of patterns themselves (some have multiple implementations).

`src\Demo` contains usage demonstration of every implementation and some more complex scenarios (`WidgetGadget.hs` contains mocked scenario from Enterprise Integration Patterns book).
